This folder contains the results of the manual labeling of Brodmann areas 44 and 45 based on resting-state functional connectivity for 101 individual subjects from the preprocessed ICA-FIX denoised Q3 release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

Data are binary labels in standard HCP fs_LR_32k grayordinate space.

Also included are the probability maps of Brodmann areas 44 and 45, created by averaging across the binary manual labels of all 101 subjects.

Detailed descriptions of the manual labeling and data processing procedures can be found in:
Jakobsen, E., Boettger, J., Bellec, P., Geyer, S., Ruebsamen, R., Petrides, M., Margulies, D.S. (2016). Subdivision of Brocaâ€™s region based on individual-level functional connectivity. European Journal of Neuroscience.

Each label file name contains the area identifier (e.g. BA44) and the HCP subject identifier (e.g. 100307). The corresponding datasets can be downloaded through the HCP Database, ConnectomeDB (https://db.humanconnectome.org/).
